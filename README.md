Easy way to take a screenshot. Double-click the JAR file (out/artifacts
directory) and you'll have a nice icon in your system tray!

### Tests
It's been tested on Gnome Shell, and it looks ugly because of Gnome Shell.
But on a system with a normal System Tray (KDE, Xfce, Windows, Mac...) it
should be seen alright!

### TODO
* Proper filtering of files
* Custom icon
* Moar testz
* Add swag
